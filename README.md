Hi, and Welcome to the ButtlerBot Github Repo!

Hi! I'm Mekasu. Also known as Shellbyy :D and Welcome to my repo for the ButtlerBot for discord! Here you will find any and all files/folders pertaining to the ButtlerBot himself. The bot is broken down into versions. The way I am numbering this version layout for this repo is ButtlerBot V0.0.2, and then it will go up by 0.0.2 for each version step. As of current, we are on 0.2.2. If you have any questions or concerns that pertain to ButtlerBot, please DM me on discord @ Shellbyy#8025. Once we have a discord setup for ButtlerBot, I will be editing this readme. Thanks :D





***TO MY DEV TEAM, AND PROGRAMMING GROUP*** Always look for ***final commit*** on my commits to know when I am done with a file/folder.

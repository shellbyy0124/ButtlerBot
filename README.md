# ButtlerBot

[![Python 3]](https://www.python.org/)

Hi, and Welcome to the ButtlerBot Github Repo!

Hi! I'm Mekasu. Also known as Shellbyy :D and Welcome to my repo for the ButtlerBot for discord! Here you will find any and all files/folders pertaining to the ButtlerBot himself. The bot is broken down into versions. The way I am numbering this version layout for this repo is ButtlerBot_v_0.0.1 is the very first bit of code that got the bot up and going himself. My counting system that I will be using for these different versions as I release updates for this bot is going to be 0.0.1,0.0.2,0.0.3. . .0.0.9 then it changes to 0.1.1, 0.1.2, 0.1.3, . . .0.1.9, 0.2.1, 0.2.2, and so on. If you have any questions or concerns that pertain to ButtlerBot, please DM me on discord @ Shellbyy#8025. Once we have a discord setup for ButtlerBot, I will be editing this readme. Thanks :D

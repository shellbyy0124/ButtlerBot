Hi, and Welcome to the ButtlerBot Github Repo!

Hi! I'm Mekasu. Also known as Shellbyy :D and Welcome to my repo for the ButtlerBot for discord! Here you will find any and all files/folders pertaining to the ButtlerBot himself. The bot is broken down into versions. The way I am numbering this version layout for this repo is ButtlerBot V0.0.2, and then it will go up by 0.0.2 for each version step. As of current, we are on 0.2.2. If you have any questions or concerns that pertain to ButtlerBot, please DM me on discord @ Shellbyy#8025. Once we have a discord setup for ButtlerBot, I will be editing this readme. Thanks :D

__THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN USING BUTTLERBOT WITHIN YOUR DISCORD__

```MY BUTTLERBOTS TOKEN IS NOT INCLUDED WITHIN THE MASTER.JSON FILE. YOU WILL NEED TO RUN THE COMMAND !UPDATEMYDISCORD TO GET THE FILES SETUP FOR YOU. THIS WILL RUN A LOOP THAT WILL PULL ALL OF THE FOLLOWING:
- MEMBERS
    - IMPORTED INTO THE MEMBERS.JSON FILE
    - WHEN WRITING TO THE JSON, IT AUTOMATICALLY STARTS EACH MEMBER WITH 0 WARNING COUNTS AND $1,000 FOR THE COINFLIP GAME, AND FUTURE ARCADE GAMES THAT ARE ADDED       IN FUTURE UPDATES. IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE STARTING BALANCE, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO TO THE COGS FOLDER, THEN TO THE STAFF.PY FILE. SCROLL DOWN TO LINE
      323 AND LOOK FOR `"bank" : 1000` AND CHANGE THE 1000 TO THE STARTING AMOUNT YOU WANT FOR YOUR DISCORD MEMBERS, AND THEN RUN THE COMMAND. ENSURE THAT YOU DO 
      THIS BEFORE YOU ALLOW USERS TO INTERACT WITH THE BOT AS IT WILL REWRITE THE ENTIRE JSON FILE AND RESET EVERY MEMBERS PROFILE.
- TEXT CHANNELS
    - VOICE CHANNELS WILL BE ADDED IN VERSION 0.4.8
- ROLES
    - IT IMPORTS THE NAMES AND IDS OF THE ROLES
